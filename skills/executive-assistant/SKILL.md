## Document Organization

### Folder Structure (Recommended)
```
/Work
  /Soapbox
    /Projects
      /Shakespeare
      /diVine
    /Conferences
      /Bitcoin-2026
      /BTC++
      /NosVegas
    /Admin
      /Contracts
      /Invoices
      /Expenses
  /NostrPlebs
  /Archive
```

### File Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD_ProjectName_DocumentType_Version`

Examples:
- `2026-01-05_Bitcoin2026_SpeakerApp_v1.docx`
- `2026-01-05_Soapbox_Invoice_001.pdf`
- `2026-01-05_NosVegas_Budget_v2.xlsx`

### Document Processing Workflow
When receiving documents:
1. **Rename** using convention
2. **File** in appropriate folder
3. **Extract action items** if any
4. **Note expiration/deadlines** if applicable
5. **Archive** original if modified

## Staying on Track

### Focus Techniques

**Time Blocking:**
- Block 2-4 hour chunks for deep work
- Batch similar tasks together
- Protect focus time from meetings
- Build in buffer time

**Pomodoro Variation:**
- 50 minutes focused work
- 10 minute break
- After 4 cycles, longer break

**Daily Shutdown:**
1. Review what got done
2. Update task list
3. Identify tomorrow's top 3
4. Clear workspace
5. Set out-of-office or close apps

### Procrastination Busters
When stuck:
- **Smallest next action** - What's the tiniest step?
- **2-minute start** - Commit to just 2 minutes
- **Change environment** - Move locations
- **Body double** - Work alongside someone
- **Reward scheduling** - Treat after completion

### Energy Management
Match task type to energy:
- **High energy:** Creative work, strategic thinking, difficult conversations
- **Medium energy:** Meetings, email, collaboration
- **Low energy:** Admin, filing, routine tasks

## Subcontractor Admin

## Workflow Tools Integration

### Obsidian Vault
Derek's work files live in an Obsidian vault:

**Key Directories:**
- `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Tasks/` - Daily task files (auto-generated)
- `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Schedule/` - Daily schedule files
- `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Meetings/` - Meeting notes and prep docs
- `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Tasks/Reports/` - Weekly completion reports

**Key Files:**
- `Work/Tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-tasks.md` - Daily task files (auto-generated)
- `Work/Schedule/YYYY-MM-DD-schedule.md` - Daily schedules
- `Meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-or-attendee.md` - Meeting notes
- `Work/Tasks/Reports/YYYY-WNN-report.md` - Weekly completion reports

**Daily Task File Contents:**
- Today's calendar events
- Taskwarrior pending tasks
- GitLab todos
- MRs awaiting review
- MRs assigned/authored
- Issues assigned/authored
- Recent project activity

### Taskwarrior

Derek uses Taskwarrior for task management. **Always use Taskwarrior** for creating, tracking, and completing tasks.

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# Create a task
task add "Task description" priority:H project:soapbox due:tomorrow

# List pending tasks
task list

# Complete a task
task <id> done

# View task details
task <id> info

# Modify a task
task <id> modify priority:M due:friday

# List tasks by project
task project:soapbox list

# Show today's tasks
task due:today list
```

**Priority Levels:**
- `priority:H` - High (urgent/blocking)
- `priority:M` - Medium (important)
- `priority:L` - Low (can wait)

**GitLab-Linked Tasks:**
Tasks synced from GitLab have custom attributes:
- `gitlab_id` - Unique GitLab identifier
- `gitlab_type` - "issue" or "mr"
- `gitlab_url` - Link to GitLab item
- `gitlab_project` - Project name

```bash
# List GitLab tasks
task +gitlab list

# View GitLab-specific info
task gitlab_project:soapbox list
```

**When Derek asks you to:**
- "Add a task" → Use `task add`
- "Mark that done" → Use `task <id> done`
- "What's on my plate?" → Use `task list` or read the daily tasks file
- "Create a task for X" → Use `task add "X" priority:M`

### Taskwarrior & Document Sync

**IMPORTANT:** When modifying any document that contains tasks (schedules, task files, meeting notes, etc.), you MUST keep Taskwarrior in sync.

**When adding tasks to a document:**
1. First check if the task exists in Taskwarrior: `task project:<project> list` or search
2. If not found, add it to Taskwarrior: `task add "Task description" project:<project> priority:H due:<date>`
3. Then add it to the document

**When marking tasks complete in a document:**
1. Mark it complete in the document (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
2. Find the corresponding task in Taskwarrior: `task project:<project> list`
3. Mark it done in Taskwarrior: `task <id> done`

**When building schedules or daily task files:**
1. If user requests adding a new task, add to BOTH the document AND Taskwarrior
2. If user says they completed a task, update BOTH the document AND Taskwarrior
3. Always verify sync by checking both systems

**Workflow Example:**
```bash
# User says: "Add a task to book Will's hotel"
task add "Book Moxy hotel room for Will" project:nostrnights priority:H due:2026-01-20
# Then add to the schedule/task document

# User says: "I booked Will's hotel"
task project:nostrnights list  # Find the task ID
task <id> done                  # Mark complete in Taskwarrior
# Then mark [x] in the document
```

This ensures the daily task files (auto-generated from Taskwarrior) stay accurate and nothing falls through the cracks.

### khal Calendar

Derek's calendar is synced via khal (connected to Google Calendar via vdirsyncer).

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# View today's events
khal list today

# View this week
khal list today 7d

# View specific date
khal list 2026-01-15

# Add a new event
khal new 2026-01-15 14:00 15:00 "Meeting with Alex"

# Add all-day event
khal new 2026-01-15 "Conference Day"

# Interactive calendar view
khal interactive
```

**Creating Calendar Events:**
```bash
# Format: khal new [date] [start] [end] "title" [-l location] [-d description]
khal new tomorrow 10:00 11:00 "Team standup" -l "Google Meet"

# Multi-day event
khal new 2026-01-20 2026-01-22 "Bitcoin Conference"
```

**Sync Calendar:**
```bash
# Pull latest from Google Calendar
vdirsyncer sync
```

**When Derek asks you to:**
- "What's on my calendar?" → Use `khal list today` or `khal list today 7d`
- "Schedule a meeting" → Use `khal new` with appropriate params
- "Block time for work" → Create a calendar event with `khal new`
- "What do I have tomorrow?" → Use `khal list tomorrow`

### khard Contacts

Derek's contacts are synced from Google Contacts via vdirsyncer and managed with khard.

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# List all contacts
khard list

# Search for a contact
khard list john

# Show contact details (email, phone, etc.)
khard show "John Smith"

# Add a new contact
khard new

# Edit a contact
khard edit "John Smith"

# Delete a contact
khard remove "John Smith"

# Sync contacts with Google
vdirsyncer sync google_contacts
```

**Use Cases:**
- Looking up email addresses for drafting emails
- Finding phone numbers for meeting invites
- Getting contact details before meetings
- Adding new contacts after networking events
- Updating contact information

**When Derek asks you to:**
- "What's Alex's email?" → Use `khard show alex`
- "Look up John's phone number" → Use `khard show john`
- "Find the contact for [company/name]" → Use `khard list [search term]`
- "Add a new contact" → Use `khard new` or create a .vcf file
- "Get me the contact info for tomorrow's meeting attendees" → Check calendar with `khal`, then look up each attendee with `khard show`

**Integration with Other Tools:**
- Before drafting emails, look up recipient's email with khard
- When preparing meeting agendas, pull attendee contact details
- For conference follow-ups, look up contacts by company or event tag

### GitLab Integration

GitLab data syncs automatically via cron and can be manually triggered.

**Scripts Location:** `/home/raven/Projects/devRel/`

**Manual Sync:**
```bash
# Run full daily sync (calendar + GitLab + Taskwarrior)
cd /home/raven/Projects/devRel && python3 daily_sync.py --sync-to-taskwarrior

# Dry run (print output, don't save)
python3 daily_sync.py --dry-run

# Generate weekly report
python3 weekly_report.py --dry-run
```

**Cron Schedule:**
- Daily sync: 8am every day
- Weekly report: Fridays at 5pm

**What Gets Synced:**
- GitLab MRs (review requested, assigned, authored, approved)
- GitLab issues (assigned, authored)
- GitLab todos
- Starred project activity
- Calendar events for the day
- Taskwarrior tasks

### Daily Workflow Integration

**Morning Routine:**
1. Check daily tasks file: `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-tasks.md`
2. Review calendar: `khal list today`
3. Review Taskwarrior: `task list`
4. Prioritize work based on MRs needing review (blocking others)

**Throughout the Day:**
- Create tasks as work items arise: `task add`
- Mark tasks complete: `task <id> done`
- Block focus time: `khal new` to create calendar events
- Check for updates: Reference the daily tasks file

**End of Day:**
- Mark completed tasks done in Taskwarrior
- Review tomorrow's calendar: `khal list tomorrow`
- Note any blockers for tomorrow

**Weekly Review (Fridays):**
- Check weekly report: `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Tasks/Reports/YYYY-WNN-report.md`
- Review completed tasks
- Plan next week's priorities

### Creating Meeting Notes

**Meeting Notes Location:** `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-or-attendee.md`

When Derek has a new meeting or asks to prepare for a meeting:

1. **Check the calendar** with `khal list` to get meeting details
2. **Create meeting notes** in the Meetings directory with:
   - Date, time, duration, location/link
   - Attendees with contact info
   - Purpose of the meeting
   - Prep checklist (tasks to complete before)
   - Talking points from the calendar invite description
   - Discovery questions (for sales/intro calls)
   - Space for notes, decisions, and action items
3. **Add a prep task** to Taskwarrior: `task add "Prep for [meeting]" project:[project] priority:H due:[meeting-date]`
4. **Update the schedule** to include prep time
5. **Sync calendar** if needed: `vdirsyncer sync`

**Meeting Notes Filename Convention:**
`YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
Examples:
- `2026-01-14-skater-soapbox-discovery.md`
- `2026-01-13-soapbox-team-meeting.md`
- `2026-01-15-nostr-101-session.md`

### Building Daily Schedules

**Generic Template:** `schedule-template.md` (in this skill directory)
**Live DevRel Template:** `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/daily-task-schedule.md`
**Schedule Output Location:** `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Schedule/YYYY-MM-DD-schedule.md`

When Derek asks you to build a daily schedule, create a schedule, or plan the day:

1. **Read the live template** at `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/daily-task-schedule.md` (has current projects/milestones)
2. **Read today's tasks** from `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-tasks.md`
3. **Check the calendar** with `khal list today`
4. **Build the schedule** using the DevRel time blocks from the template
5. **Save the schedule** to `/home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Schedule/YYYY-MM-DD-schedule.md`

**DevRel Daily Time Blocks:**
| Time | Block | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| 8:00-10:00 | Community Engagement | Nostr, social, answering questions |
| 10:00-12:00 | Code Review & Issue Triage | GitHub/GitLab, PRs, NIPs |
| 12:00-13:00 | Lunch & Async Catch-up | Email, calendar review |
| 13:00-15:30 | Development & Project Work | Deep work, building, shipping |
| 15:30-17:00 | Content Creation | Tutorials, docs, videos, social |
| 17:00-18:00 | Event & Conference Planning | CFPs, talks, travel, logistics |
| 18:00-18:30 | End of Day Wrap-up | Review, tomorrow's priorities |

**Weekly Focus Days:**
| Day | Primary Focus |
|-----|---------------|
| Monday | Week planning, review metrics, set goals |
| Tuesday | Deep dev work - minimize meetings |
| Wednesday | Content creation - publish blog/video |
| Thursday | Community calls, AMAs, live sessions |
| Friday | Week review, documentation cleanup |

**Schedule Building Process:**
1. Identify current time and which block we're in (or starting from)
2. Mark completed blocks as done
3. Layer calendar events onto the template blocks
4. **If user adds new tasks:** Add to BOTH the schedule document AND Taskwarrior
5. **If user completes tasks:** Mark done in BOTH the schedule document AND Taskwarrior
6. Prioritize tasks by:
   - Due date (soonest first)
   - Priority level (!!! > !! > !)
   - Blocking items (failed builds, MRs needing action)
   - Time-sensitive items (releases, meetings)
5. Assign tasks to appropriate blocks based on task type:
   - Code/PR work → Development block
   - Writing/docs → Content Creation block
   - Conference/travel → Event Planning block
   - Community questions → Community Engagement block
6. Note any evening commitments from the calendar
7. Respect the daily focus (e.g., Wednesday = content day)

**Output Format:**
```markdown
# DAILY SCHEDULE — [Day], [Full Date]

**Focus:** [Weekly Focus] 💜🟠

**Tasks:** [[YYYY-MM-DD-tasks]]

---

### ✅ COMPLETED BLOCKS
[List completed time blocks]

### [CURRENT BLOCK EMOJI] [TIME] — [BLOCK NAME] (NOW)
**Priority Tasks:**
- [ ] Task 1 (priority/due info)
- [ ] Task 2

### [NEXT BLOCK EMOJI] [TIME] — [BLOCK NAME]
[Tasks for this block]

... continue for remaining blocks ...

### 🏠 EVENING COMMITMENTS
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| HH:MM | Event name |
```

### Obsidian Linking

**IMPORTANT:** Use Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` to connect related documents. This creates a navigable knowledge graph.

**Daily Schedules → Daily Tasks:**
Schedules are derived from task files, so schedules should link to their source:
```markdown
**Tasks:** [[2026-01-09-tasks]]
```

**Weekly Reports → Daily Tasks:**
Weekly reports summarize the week's tasks, so they should link to each day:
```markdown
## Daily Breakdowns
- [[2026-01-06-tasks|Monday]]
- [[2026-01-07-tasks|Tuesday]]
- [[2026-01-08-tasks|Wednesday]]
- [[2026-01-09-tasks|Thursday]]
- [[2026-01-10-tasks|Friday]]
```

**Linking Best Practices:**
- Source documents (tasks) don't need to link forward to derived documents
- Derived documents (schedules, reports) should link back to their sources
- Use `[[filename|Display Text]]` for cleaner display
- Links enable Obsidian's graph view and backlinks panel

### Obsidian Tags

Use hashtags to make documents searchable and filterable in Obsidian.

**Product Tags:**
- `#shakespeare` - Shakespeare AI builder
- `#ditto` - Ditto social client
- `#nostrhub` - NostrHub dev platform
- `#soapbox` - General Soapbox work
- `#divine` - diVine creator platform

**Activity Tags:**
- `#podcast` - Soapbox Sessions podcast
- `#jamsession` - Monday Vibe Coding Jam
- `#workshop` - Shakespeare workshops
- `#conference` - Conference-related
- `#meetup` - Local meetups

**Project Tags:**
- `#nostrnights` - Nostr Nights events
- `#bitcoin2026` - Bitcoin Conference 2026
- `#btcpp` - BTC++ conference
- `#nosvegas` - NosVegas event
- `#aihack4freedom` - AI Hack for Freedom

**Status/Type Tags:**
- `#devrel` - Developer relations work
- `#nostr` - Nostr ecosystem
- `#aos` - And Other Stuff collective

**Tagging Best Practices:**
- Add relevant tags at the end of task descriptions or in document headers
- Use 1-3 tags per item (don't over-tag)
- Tags in schedules help filter by project/activity type
- Consistent tagging enables powerful searches like `#podcast #soapbox`

**Example Usage:**
```markdown
# DAILY SCHEDULE — Friday, January 9, 2026

**Tags:** #devrel #soapbox

---

## ⚡ 1:00 PM - Development
- [ ] Work on Shakespeare improvements #shakespeare
- [ ] Prep for Monday jam session #jamsession
```
