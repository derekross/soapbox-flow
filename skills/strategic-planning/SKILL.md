## Planning Framework

### 1. Define the Vision

- Constraints and limitations
- Dependencies on others
- Risks and unknowns

### 3. Strategic Pillars
Break the goal into 3-5 major workstreams:

- Each has its own owner/lead

### 4. Tactical Breakdown
For each pillar:
- Key milestones with dates
- Specific tasks
- Dependencies between tasks
- Success criteria

### 5. Timeline & Rhythm
- Work backwards from deadline
- Build in buffer time (20% minimum)
