## Presentation Principles

### Structure
1. **Opening Hook** - Start with a compelling problem or vision (1-2 slides)
2. **Context** - Set the stage, why this matters now (2-3 slides)
3. **Core Content** - Main points, demos, technical details (varies)
4. **Call to Action** - What you want the audience to do (1-2 slides)
5. **Resources** - Links, QR codes, contact info (1 slide)

### Design Guidelines
- **One idea per slide** - Don't overload
- **Large fonts** - Minimum 24pt for body, 36pt+ for headers
- **High contrast** - Ensure readability in any lighting
- **Minimal text** - Use speaker notes for details
- **Consistent branding** - Match event or company colors

### Technical Presentations
For developer/technical audiences:
