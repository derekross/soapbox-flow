## Workshop Scripts

### Shakespeare Workshop Opening (5 min)

```
Hey everyone, welcome! I'm Derek from Soapbox, and today we're going to build
something together using Shakespeare - an open-source AI website builder.

By the end of this hour, you'll have a working website that you built and own.

Quick show of hands - how many of you have used Wix, Squarespace, or Webflow before?
[Wait for responses]

Those tools work, but here's the thing - you don't really own what you build there.
They can change their terms, raise prices, or shut down, and your site goes with it.

Shakespeare is different. You describe what you want, AI helps you build it,
and you deploy it to infrastructure you control. No vendor lock-in.

Before we dive in, let me show you what's possible...
[5-minute live demo - build something simple]

Alright, who's ready to build? Scan this QR code to get your free credits...
```

### Shakespeare Workshop Closing (5 min)

```
Amazing work everyone! Let's take a few minutes to show off what you built.
[Showcase segment - 1-2 min per person]

Before you go, a few things:
1. Your site is live - share that URL!
2. You can keep building - add more pages, iterate on the design
3. Join the Shakespeare community on Flotilla to share your work and get help
4. Follow @soapbox on Nostr for updates

The QR code on screen has all the links.

Remember: what you built today, you own. That's what freedom tech is about.

Thanks for building with us!

## Conference Booth Pitches

### The 30-Second Pitch

```
"Ever wish you could build a website just by describing it?

Shakespeare is an open-source AI builder. You tell it what you want,
it writes the code, you deploy it anywhere.

No lock-in. No monthly fees. You own everything.

Scan the QR, try it free. Takes 60 seconds to build your first site."
```

### The 2-Minute Demo Script

```
"Let me show you something cool.

[Open Shakespeare]

I'm going to build a landing page for a Bitcoin meetup. Watch this.

[Type prompt: 'Create a landing page for Austin Bitcoin Meetup with date,
location, and RSVP button. Use orange and black colors.']

See how it's generating the code? This is real HTML, CSS, JavaScript -
not some proprietary format.

[Wait for generation]

Here's the preview. Pretty good for 30 seconds of work, right?

Now here's the key part - I click deploy, and it goes live.
That URL? I own it. I can point my own domain at it.

No Squarespace, no Wix, no monthly fees.
And because it's open source, this will exist as long as the internet does.

Want to try? Scan this, you get free credits to build something yourself."

## Nostr Threads

### Thread: Why Nostr Matters (7 posts)

**Post 1 (Hook):**
```
You don't own your Twitter followers.

You don't own your Instagram posts.

You don't own your Facebook memories.

On Nostr, you own everything. Here's why that matters:

Thread
```

**Post 2:**
```
On Twitter, your "followers" are actually Twitter's users who clicked a button.

If Twitter bans you, suspends you, or just changes their algorithm -
those connections vanish.

On Nostr, your followers are cryptographic.
They signed a message saying "I follow this public key."

That signature lives on multiple servers you don't control. Nobody can unsign it.
```

**Post 3:**
```
Your content works the same way.

Every post you make is signed with your private key.

That signature proves you wrote it - forever.

It can be stored on any relay. Copied. Archived.
No single company decides if your words survive.
```

**Post 4:**
```
"But what if relays block me?"

They can! And that's fine.

Your followers' clients will look for you on other relays.
Your content exists wherever you (or anyone) puts it.

One relay blocking you is not the same as Twitter deleting your account.
```

**Post 5:**
```
"Okay but this sounds complicated"

It's not. Here's the user experience:

1. Download a client (Damus, Primal, Amethyst)
2. It creates your keys
3. Post like normal

The crypto happens in the background.
You just... use social media. But you actually own it.
```

**Post 6:**
```
The real magic? Interoperability.

I post from Damus. You read on Primal. Someone else uses Amethyst.

We all see the same content.

Try doing that with Twitter and Instagram.
```

**Post 7 (CTA):**
```
If you're reading this on Nostr - you get it. Welcome.

If someone shared this elsewhere - come try it.

Your social life shouldn't be rented from a corporation.

nostr.com/clients - pick one and own your future.
```

### Thread: What is Shakespeare? (5 posts)

**Post 1 (Hook):**
```
I built a website in 2 minutes without writing code.

Then I deployed it to the decentralized web.

Here's how:

**Post 2:**
```
Shakespeare is an open-source AI website builder.

You describe what you want in plain English.
AI generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You preview, edit, and deploy.

No accounts. No monthly fees. You own the output.

shakespeare.diy
```

**Post 3:**
```
"AI website builders exist. What's different?"

Two things:

1. Open source - the code is public, anyone can run it
2. Decentralized deployment - your site goes to infrastructure you control

Wix can't delete your Shakespeare site. Because it doesn't live on Wix.
```

**Post 4:**
```
What can you build?

- Landing pages
- Personal sites
- Project showcases
- Nostr-native apps (it knows how to use Nostr!)
- Interactive tools

It's not WordPress-replacement complex.
It's "I need a thing and I need it now" fast.
```

**Post 5 (CTA):**
```
Try it: shakespeare.diy

Free tier available. No credit card.

Build something in 5 minutes and own it forever.

## Reddit Posts

### r/nostr - Shakespeare Announcement

**Title:** Built an AI website builder for the Nostr ecosystem - Shakespeare is now open source

**Body:**
```
Hey r/nostr,

I work at Soapbox and wanted to share something we've been building:
Shakespeare, an open-source AI website builder designed with Nostr in mind.

**What it does:**
- Describe what you want in plain English
- AI generates working HTML/CSS/JS
- Deploy to decentralized infrastructure
- No vendor lock-in, you own the output

**Why Nostr folks might care:**
- It knows how to build Nostr-native apps
- NIP-98 authentication for deployment
- Can generate apps that read/write to Nostr
- Pairs with Blossom for media storage

**Not a sales pitch:**
This is open source. You can self-host it. The repo is at [link].

We also have a free tier at shakespeare.diy if you just want to try it.

**Looking for feedback:**
- What would you build with this?
- What Nostr integrations would be useful?
- Any NIPs we should prioritize?

Happy to answer questions. Been lurking here for a while,
excited to finally share something.
```

### r/webdev - Shakespeare Introduction

**Title:** Open-source AI website builder that actually gives you the code

**Body:**
```
Tired of AI builders that lock you into proprietary formats?

We built Shakespeare - an open-source AI website builder where
you actually own what you create.

**How it works:**
1. Describe what you want
2. AI generates real HTML/CSS/JS (not some locked format)
3. Preview and iterate
4. Deploy anywhere (or download the files)

**Key differences from Wix/Squarespace/etc:**
- You get the actual source code
- No monthly hosting fees required
- Self-hostable (it's open source)
- No account needed to try it

**What it's good for:**
- Quick landing pages
- Portfolio sites
- Project demos
- Prototyping

**What it's NOT:**
- Not a WordPress replacement for complex sites
- Not trying to compete with Webflow for enterprise
- Not a "real programmer" replacement

It's a "I need a thing and I don't want to spend 3 hours on it" tool.

Try it: shakespeare.diy
Repo: [gitlab link]

Would love feedback from this community. What features would make
this actually useful for your workflow?

## Objection Handling

### "Isn't this just Twitter?"

```
Fair question. The key differences:

1. **You own your identity** - Your account is a cryptographic key pair.
   No company controls it.

2. **You own your content** - Posts are signed by your key, stored on
   multiple servers. No single point of deletion.

3. **You own your social graph** - Followers are cryptographic signatures,
   not database entries a company controls.

4. **No algorithm gatekeeping** - Posts go to everyone who follows you.
   No pay-to-play, no suppression.

Same user experience, different ownership model.
```

### "Why would I need decentralized social?"

```
Maybe you don't! If you've never been:
- Banned or suspended unfairly
- Shadow-banned for unclear reasons
- Worried about a platform shutting down
- Frustrated by algorithm changes

Then centralized platforms might work fine for you.

But if you've ever lost an account, had reach throttled, or watched
a community die when a platform changed direction -
you understand why owning your social presence matters.

Nostr is insurance. Your content, your connections, your choice.
```

### "This is too technical for normal people"

```
It's actually not! The technical stuff happens under the hood.

User experience:
1. Download an app (like Damus or Primal)
2. App creates your keys automatically
3. Post, follow, like - just like any social app

You don't need to understand cryptography any more than you need to
understand TCP/IP to use the internet.

The difference is what happens behind the scenes -
and that difference protects you.
```

### "Nobody I know uses Nostr"

```
True for most new networks! A few thoughts:

1. **Quality over quantity** - The people on Nostr tend to be
   builders, creators, and thinkers. Smaller but engaged.

2. **Bridge communities** - Many Nostr users cross-post to Twitter.
   You can follow both.

3. **Be early** - When your Twitter friends eventually get banned
   or frustrated, you'll already have a presence here.

4. **The network effects are starting** - Major clients like Primal
   are making it easier. Growth is accelerating.

You don't have to abandon other platforms.
Just plant a flag on territory you actually own.
```
